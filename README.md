# 🖱 mouse-html

⚡ A simple and lightweight npm package for giving your elements click and hover functionality right in your html. It allows you to create simple dropdowns or sidebars right inside your html without having to write a single line of javascript.


## 🌍 Installation

Paste this right in your html:
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/mouse-html@1.1.15" type="module" defer></script>
```

## 🚀 Features

### 🖱 Mouse Click and Hover

Add a `mouse-click` or `mouse-hover` attribute to your html element:

```html
<button mouse-hover=".box">Show Div</button>
```

The value inside the attribute is the `document.querySelector()` property, and selects the DOM element that matches:

```html
<button mouse-click=".box">Show Div</button>
<div class="box">just a div with a class</div>
```

```html
<button mouse-click="#box">Show Div</button>
<div id="box">just a div with an id</div>
```

```html
<button mouse-click="div">Show Div</button>
<div>just a div</div>
```

A hidden class `.hidden { display: none }` automatically gets added to the element specified in the attributes.

### ✨ Mouse Swap

Add a `mouse-swap` attribute to your html element:

```html
<button mouse-swap=".box">Show Div</button>
```

This attribute creates a swapping `onclick` relationship between the element with the attribute and the element specified inside the attribute:

```html
<button mouse-swap="#box">Click me to hide me, and show the div</button>
<div id="box">Click Me to hide me, and show the button</div>
```

The element that has then `mouse-swap` attribute is initially visible, while the element specified in the attributes is initially hidden.

### 🎉 Animations

You can add a `mouse-animation` attribute to an element in the DOM:

```html
<div class="box" animation="fade">just a div with animation</div>
```

This adds an CSS animation effect to the element, which applies to the element only when it *appears* in the DOM. You can add this attribute to any element or combine with the other attributes. By default each animation has its own animation-timing which cannot be changed. The animations currently available are:<br>

1. fade
2. X
3. Y

X and Y animations also take a optional `mouse-animation-length` attribute in which you set the number of pixels the element travels - the pixel value can be both *positive* and *negative*:

```html
<button mouse-swap="div">Click Me to see div, and hide me</button>
<div mouse-animation="fade">Click Me to hide me, and see the button again</div>
```

```html
<button mouse-click=".box">Click Me to see div, and hide me</button>
<div class="box" mouse-animation="X" mouse-animation-length="-500">I translate X by 500 pixels</div>
```

You can also create custom CSS animations:

```html
<div class="box" animation="spring">just a div with animation</div>
```

```css
@keyframes spring {

    0% {
        transform: scale(1);
    }

    30% {
        transform: scale(1.2);
    }
    
    50% {
        transform: scale(0.9);
    }

    70% {
        transform: scale(1.1);
    }

    100% {
        transform: scale(1);
    }

}

.spring {
  animation: spring 0.6s cubic-bezier(0.5, 1.5, 0.5, 1) forwards;
}
```
